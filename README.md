# JUGS planner

This solution uses the OPTIC-CLP solver to determine the best sequence for the jugs problem.
<br>
It uses a jug capacity and actual volume, with actions such as empty, fill, pour-empty (completely empties a jug on another), pour-fill (completely fullfils a jug) to indicate the best sequence to get to its goal.
